## ðŸ§­ How It Connects

The **docs** are designed to work hand-in-hand with the **blog**:

| Purpose               | Blog | Docs |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Narrative, reflection | âœ…   |      |
| Technical detail      |      | âœ…   |
| Research updates      | âœ…   |      |
| Method reference      |      | âœ…   |
| Tutorials             | âš¡   | âœ…   |

Together, they form a complete ecosystem â€” combining open communication with rigorous, transparent science.
