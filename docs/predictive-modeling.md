# Predictive Modeling in Crop Science

Predictive modeling integrates statistics, machine learning, and agronomic data to **forecast plant performance**, identify key traits, and improve decision-making in breeding programs.

---

## 📈 Core Modeling Tasks

1. **Trait Prediction** — estimating yield, quality, or stress tolerance.
2. **Environment Modeling** — incorporating climate and soil data for GxE analysis.
3. **Selection Optimization** — prioritizing crosses and candidates with highest expected gain.
4. **Risk Forecasting** — modeling vulnerability to pests, drought, or market volatility.

## 🧮 Typical Data Inputs

| Data Type     | Examples                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Genomic       | SNP markers, haplotypes                      |
| Phenotypic    | Yield, leaf traits, metabolite profiles      |
| Environmental | Rainfall, temperature, soil data             |
| Management    | Fertilizer rates, spacing, irrigation regime |

## 🧠 Common Algorithms

- **Linear regression** (baseline for interpretability)
- **Random forests** (nonlinear relationships, trait interactions)
- **Gradient boosting** (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- **Neural networks** (deep learning for complex traits)
- **Bayesian models** (uncertainty quantification and prior integration)

---

## ⚡ Workflow Example (R/Python)

1. Prepare datasets
2. Split into training/test sets
3. Train multiple algorithms
4. Evaluate metrics (R², RMSE, accuracy)
5. Select best-performing model
6. Deploy in a breeding decision dashboard or Shiny app

## 🔍 Visualization & Interpretation

Use:

- SHAP values or feature importance plots for interpretability
- Partial dependence plots to visualize trait-environment responses
- Correlation heatmaps for multi-trait prediction

---

## 🌾 Recommended Tools

- **R:** `caret`, `tidymodels`, `BGLR`, `sommer`, `ranger`
- **Python:** `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Visualization:** `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `seaborn`
