Welcome to the **Plant Genetix Blog** — a space for sharing ideas, methods, and reflections from my work in **plant genomics**, **quantitative genetics**, and **data-driven breeding**.

Here, you’ll find discussions that bridge research and real-world application — from genomic prediction models and bioinformatics workflows to R Shiny tools designed for exploring complex genetic data.

## What to Expect

This blog complements the documentation and research sections by offering a narrative lens on ongoing projects, results, and lessons learned from applying data science to crop improvement.

I’ll share insights from my current and past work, including research like _“Genomic selection strategies to increase genetic gain in tea breeding programs”_ (Lubanga et al., 2023), and explore how similar approaches are shaping the future of sustainable agriculture.

## Why Now

As we move into **2025–2026**, plant science is entering an exciting era — where **AI integration**, **high-throughput phenotyping**, and **genomics** are converging to accelerate discovery and impact.  
This blog aims to document that evolution, providing an open window into the tools, thinking, and collaborations driving next-generation crop improvement.
