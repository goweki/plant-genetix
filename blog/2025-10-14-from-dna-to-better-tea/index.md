## The $15 Question That Could Transform Tea Breeding

What if spending **$15 per seedling** could tell you—with 70% accuracy—whether that plant would become a high-yielding bush, years before you invested in field trials?

That’s not science fiction. It’s the reality of **genomic selection**, and it’s reshaping the economics of crop improvement worldwide. The question is: why isn’t tea keeping up?

## The Current System: High Risk, Low Information

Picture a tea breeder with 2,000 seedlings in a nursery. From these, maybe 500 advance to the next stage. But at that early stage, breeders have **almost no reliable information** about future performance—only 5% of what they see reflects true genetic potential.  
The rest? Environmental noise and random variation.

So they wait.  
Preliminary trials (≈3 years). Advanced trials (≈5 years). Elite trials (≈6 years).  
After 14–16 years, the best candidates finally emerge. But by then, climate conditions, markets, and pests have all changed.

## The Genomic Selection Alternative

Now imagine sequencing those same 2,000 seedlings at $15 each.  
You already have a **reference database** linking DNA to real-world performance in mature plants. Using that data, you build a **prediction model** that forecasts how new seedlings will perform—without waiting years.

Suddenly, selection accuracy jumps from 5% to 70%.  
You’re not guessing anymore. You’re predicting from the genetic blueprint.

## The Economic Transformation

Simulation studies spanning 40 years of breeding cycles show the impact:

- **Faster cycles:** move from 16-year to 2-year breeding cycles
- **Better accuracy:** nearly 4× improvement in selection precision
- **Higher returns:** 1.65–1.7× more genetic gain at equal or lower cost

So how does adding a $15 genotyping step actually save money?

## The Math That Makes It Work

The savings come from **what you no longer need to do**:

- **Skip preliminary trials:** DNA data replaces 3 years of early testing
- **Smaller trials:** better accuracy = fewer candidates to test
- **Faster turnover:** 8 breeding cycles in the time it used to take for one

In one cost-constrained simulation, only 800 of 2,000 seedlings were genotyped to stay within budget. Even so, the program achieved **1.7**
